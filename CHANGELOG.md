# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-07

### Changed

- Rebuilt the starter i18n system around a single source of truth in `src/site.config.ts -> i18n`.
- Added structured locale metadata, localized UI overrides, per-locale hero copy, and localized About config under `i18n.locales`.
- Completed default-locale routing support with configurable `i18n.routing.defaultLocalePrefix` behavior across runtime, SEO, and sitemap generation.
- Hardened `new-post` so it follows configured enabled locales, supports region-code locales, and safely falls back for unknown locale templates.
- Added a minimal Playwright smoke-test layer via `npm run e2e:install` and `npm run e2e`.

- Upgrade guide (`UPGRADING.md`) and changelog links in all README language variants.

### Changed

- Language switcher now preserves current route by default.
- Blog detail and blog pagination language switching now use existence-aware fallback:
  - If target-locale page exists, go to that page.
  - If not, fall back to target-locale blog index.
- Blog sample content is aligned to one post per locale (`welcome-to-anglefeint`).
- About page default content now uses neutral, non-placeholder profile/contact text.
