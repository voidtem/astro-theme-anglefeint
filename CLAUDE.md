# CLAUDE.md

Claude Code should treat this file as a thin adapter, not as the canonical workflow source.

## Required Read Order

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md`
3. `docs/DOC_METADATA_SPEC.md`
4. `README.md`
5. Task-relevant source docs:
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - `docs/VISUAL_SYSTEMS.md`
   - `docs/MAINTAINER_WORKFLOW.md`
   - `.cursor/workflows/doc-sync-workflow.md`

## Claude-Specific Note

- Prefer the repository-neutral rules in `AGENTS.md` over maintaining Claude-only workflow variants here.
- If this file and `AGENTS.md` ever conflict, `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md` win.
